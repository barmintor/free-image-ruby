    # Enlarges or shrinks an image selectively per side and fills newly added areas with the
    # specified background color.  The common use case is to add borders to an image.
    #
    # To add a border to any of the image's sides, a positive integer value must be passed in
    # any of the parameters left, top, right or bottom.  This value represents the border's
    # width in pixels. Newly created parts of the image (the border areas)
    # are filled with the specified color.
    #
    # Specifying a negative integer value for a certain side, will shrink or crop the image on
    # this side. Consequently, specifying zero for a certain side will not
    # change the image's extension on that side.
    #
    # For palletized images, the palette of the current image src is transparently
    # copied to the newly created enlarged or shrunken image, so any color look-ups
    # are performed on this palette.
    #
    # == Parameters:
    #
    # left:: The number of pixels the image should be enlarged on its left side. Negative
    #        values shrink the image on its left side.
    # top:: The number of pixels the image should be enlarged on its top side. Negative
    #       values shrink the image on its top side.
    # right:: The number of pixels the image should be enlarged on its right side. Negative
    #         values shrink the image on its right side.
    # bottom:: The number of pixels, the image should be enlarged on its bottom side.
    #          Negative values shrink the image on its bottom side.
    # color:: The color value to be used for filling the image.  See #fill_background for
    #         more details.
    # options:: Used to control color search process for palletized images. See
    #           #fill_background for more details.
    #
    # If an optional block is provided, it will be passed the new image as an argument.  The
    # image will be automatically closed when the block completes.

    #   bitmap.rescale(width, height, filter) -> bitmap
    #   bitmap.rescale(width, height, filter) {|img| block} -> bitmap -> bitmap
    #
    # Resamples an image to the desired width and height. Resampling changes the
    # pixel dimensions (and therefore display size) of an image.
    # When you downsample (or decrease the number of pixels), information is deleted from
    # the image. When you upsample (or increase the number of pixels), new pixels are
    # added based on color values of existing pixels. You can specify an interpolation
    # filter to determine how pixels are added or deleted using the filter parameter.
    #
    # Returns the newly resample image or nil if the image cannot be resampled.
    #
    # == Parameters:
    #
    # width:: The width of the new image
    # height:: The height of the new image
    # filter:: The filter to use when rescaling
    #
    # Filter options include:
    #
    # :box:: The simplest and fastest of the scaling algorithms.  The technique achieves
    #        magnification by pixel replication, and minification by sparse point sampling.
    #        For large-scale changes, box interpolation produces images with a
    #        blocky appearance. In addition, shift errors of up to one-half pixel are
    #        possible. These problems make this technique inappropriate when
    #        sub-pixel accuracy is required.
    #
    # :bicubic:: An advanced parameterized scaling filter. It uses a cubic
    #            to produce very smooth output while maintaining dynamic range
    #            and sharpness. Bicubic scaling takes approximately twice the
    #            processing time as Bilinear. This filter can be used for any
    #            scaling application, especially when scaling factors are 2X
    #            or greater.
    #
    # :bilinear:: The second-fastest scaling function. It employs linear interpolation
    #             to determine the output image. Bilinear scaling provides reasonably
    #             good results at moderate cost for most applications where scale
    #             factors are relatively small (4X or less).
    #
    # :bspline:: Produces the smoothest output, but tends to smooth over fine details.
    #            This function requires the same processing time as :bicubic filter.
    #            It is recommended for applications where the smoothest output is required.
    #
    # :catmullrom:: The Catmull-Rom filter is generally accepted as the best cubic interpolant filter.
    #
    # :lanczos3:: A sinc based filter. It is the most theoretically correct filter
    #             that produces the best output for photographic images that do not have
    #             sharp transitions in them. However, Lanczos will produce ripple artefacts
    #             especially for block text, due to aliasing.  It requires three times the
    #             processing time of Bilinear. Lanczos is not recommended except in very
    #             rare applications using band-limited photographic images with
    #             no sharp edges.
    #
    # If an optional block is provided, it will be passed the new image as an argument.  The
    # image will be automatically closed when the block completes.
